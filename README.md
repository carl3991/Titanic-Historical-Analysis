# Titanic Historical Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover survival patterns and demonstrate predictive modeling on historical data. Using Python, the analysis combines data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning to transform raw records into actionable insights.

## Objectives
- Investigate demographic and socio-economic factors influencing survival.
- Apply classification models to predict passenger outcomes.
- Highlight the importance of model comparison in data science.

## Methods & Tools
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing survival trends across gender, age, ticket class, and embarkation port.
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression for interpretability; Random Forest for accuracy and feature importance.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, and recall to compare model performance.

## Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- Socio-economic status (ticket class and fare) strongly influenced outcomes.
- Random Forest identified passenger class, gender, and age as dominant predictors.

## Impact
Beyond technical outcomes, this project demonstrates how **data science can transform historical records into meaningful narratives**. It serves as a case study for teaching classification methods while reflecting broader themes of inequality and human behavior under crisis.

## Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
